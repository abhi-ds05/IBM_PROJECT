# PMGSY Scheme Classification using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview

This project aims to automate the classification of rural road and bridge construction projects under the **Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)** into their respective schemes (e.g., PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA). 

Manual classification is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale across thousands of projects. By using machine learning techniques, we build a robust and scalable classification model based on physical and financial characteristics of the projects.

## üöÄ Features

- Automatic classification of projects into PMGSY schemes.
- Supports models like Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
- High accuracy and performance (94.2% with XGBoost).
- Preprocessing pipeline: missing values, scaling, encoding.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.
